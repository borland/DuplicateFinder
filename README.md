DuplicateFinder
===============

I couldn't find any decent applications on the mac app store for finding and removing duplicate files. There are many, but none free.
This app attempts to solve that problem. 

It's also the first OS X (and the third objective-C application) I've ever worked on. As such it most likely does not follow standard OS X "best practices" or other such things. It's basically a test project.

Enjoy
